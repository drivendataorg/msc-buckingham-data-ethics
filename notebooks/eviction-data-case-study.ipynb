    "Over the past five decades, [housing costs have risen faster than incomes](http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/state-nations-housing-2018), low-cost housing has been disappearing from the market, and racial disparities in homeownership rates have deepened. This has put many in a perilous situation. As the [Eviction Lab](https://evictionlab.org/why-eviction-matters/#affordable-housing-crisis) explains:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Today, most poor renting families spend at least half of their income on housing costs, with one in four of those families spending over 70 percent of their income just on rent and utilities. Only one in four families who qualify for affordable housing programs get any kind of help. Under those conditions, it has become harder for low-income families to keep up with rent and utility costs, and a growing number are living one misstep or emergency away from eviction.\n"
